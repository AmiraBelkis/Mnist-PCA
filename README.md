**Project Title: Image Compression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the MNIST Dataset**

**Objective:**

To apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset to effectively compress image size while preserving crucial information.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Acquisition:** Acquire the MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is represented by a 28x28 pixel matrix, resulting in a total of 784 features per image.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Standardize the pixel intensities to ensure a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one for each feature. This facilitates PCA in identifying the most significant patterns in the data.

3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Implement PCA on the standardized data, projecting it onto a lower-dimensional subspace while maintaining the maximum variance in the original dataset.

4. **Image Compression:** Reconstruct the compressed images from the reduced set of principal components. Evaluate the trade-off between compression rate and image quality.

**Technologies Utilized:**

* **Python:** Programming language for data manipulation and algorithm implementation.

* **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing and retrieving the MNIST dataset.

* **Matplotlib:** Python library for data visualization and generating plots.

* **NumPy:** Numerical computing library for efficient array operations.

* **Pandas:** Data analysis and manipulation library for processing and handling tabular data.

* **scikit-learn:** Machine learning library, specifically utilizing the PCA module for dimensionality reduction.

* **Keras:** Deep learning library for neural network modeling.
